      "Yes, Singapore is a democracy, and it may seem unfair that the men are being forced to serve NS. But where do you draw the line between necessity and free choice? In a Singapore where you had been in the ruling party and had made NS optional, how many men would actually volunteer to serve in NS? Hardly half the country, I believe. With that small a pool of people serving in the defence sector, it would be no secret to other countries that Singapore would be vulnerable to attacks. Enter raids, invasions, plundering. Alternately, we could bring in legions and legions of mercenaries. Problem solved! With the condition of an astronomical bill to pay, of course. Which means less to pay for education, healthcare, etc., and that would probably place Singapore a good distance away from where she is today. Whoops.\n",
      "Sure, none of us would want to go through 2.5 years if physical company and still OT after that. The thing is, it was an important decision on the government's part to make NS compulsory, democracy or not. You can argue that we should have the FREE CHOICE to pay taxes or not. Which, in their right minds, nobody would want to, except maybe one of the 20-odd billionaires in Singapore, on a far-off chance.

I laughed at her. But I began to take notice. She was right. You might not have been on the honor roll but no doubt you were intelligent. You played my favourite sport. I watched you play and you were quite a defender. And yes you were (still are) cute.\n",
      "Maybe I stared too much. Too long. We made eye contact. I had to be the one to break it. But you never seemed annoyed by my blatant staring. Were you flattered? Or just indifferent? Maybe, just maybe, you were intrigued? I’m sure you mentioned it to your friends. Every time I went near them, I heard their whispers, felt their stares. Not soon after, I was losing my mind. My heart (and I can’t believe I’m saying this) went into overdrive whenever we crossed paths. I subconsciously began to look for you. In the canteen. Void deck. Lift lobby. Just to catch a glimpse of you. And maybe to see if you would notice me too.\n",
      "There were good days and bad ones. On good days, you never crossed my mind. I enjoyed my time with my friends and was a productive student. On the bad days, you never left my mind. Was I reading too much into things? Probably. I hated myself on those days. I felt stupid. Angry. Sad. Like a lovesick fool.\n",
      "As the A levels drew near, things eased a little. I had more important things to focus on. Priorities to handle. I still saw you around and my traitorous heart hammered so loudly I’m sure everybody around me heard it. School ended soon after. I would be lying if I said I thought about you every day. You crossed my mind randomly and inconsistently. Still better than being all hung up on you.\n",
      "On the day of the A level results, you went on stage while I sat down, waiting anxiously. And at that very moment, I realised something. I would never be good enough for you. I was too insecure. About everything. Looks, brains,everything. You deserved more than that. More than me. Someone brave enough, confident enough to have said hello. To make you smile. To make you happy. We could have had something special or things wouldn't have worked out. But I'll never know. And I hope you find that someone who would put a smile on your face that I could only wish I could.\n",

      "\n",
      "AC was not my first choice during JAE. VJ was. I went to both VJ and AC open house last year to sort of imagine what my life would be like if I would eventually end up in either school. After visiting VJ open house, which was quite interesting, I traveled across the island to AC, and I was greeted with groups of sport people cheering AC cheers, and this smiley J2 girl who guided me around. There was so much laughter and so much life going on here. The moment I entered the Hall and I was immediately overwhelmed by the welcoming screams of the Dragon Boaters. \"Come join Dragon Boat! Come take a look!\", and I was like, \"Wow, they would want to have a tiny mini girl like me?\" I must have looked like a weird, awkward, out of place kid who was both confused and inspired by the hearts and passion the people here had. At the end of the day, I went back to my room to find out that somebody had tied to my bag this black band of fabric with \"AC Squash\" written on it, and my heart just simply melted away.

      "I'm what you'd call a socially awkward introvert, a bit weird, very shy, and I never quite fit in at my primary school and secondary school. Basically, it takes time for me to warm up to people, and most didn't bother waiting. People just sort of sized me up as the quiet kid and generally ignored me, except when they needed favours, or the nice ones would talk to me like I was a child. I guess you could say I was a pushover.\n",
      "Somehow, it changed when I came to AC. People actually made the effort to get to know me, and let me speak during group conversations - this may sound sad, but yeah. People didn't treat me like a pushover; on the contrary, they were very kind to me. It's all in the little things, like receiving a birthday text message from a classmate I'm not close to.\n",
      "I found an amazing group of friends who have been so supportive of me, even when I was at my lowest. I can be exactly who I am around them. For the first time in my life, I felt a sense of belonging - no longer an alien watching from the outside, but an ACSian. And for the first time, I enjoyed school, and looked forward to coming to school. :)\n",
      "I really came out of my shell at ACJC. New friends tell me I'm not socially awkward at all, and while I think I still retain some of my old shyness, I guess I've been mostly cured of my impediment.\n",
      "I really wish I could let my classmates know how much they mean to me, and what they have done for me, but ah, I'm too shy. But there's a chance some of you will read this, so even though it's sort of useless, I'll say this here: a lot of you think highly of me because of results etc but the truth is, you guys are the amazing ones. :') You've given me the gift of confidence, which I'm going to carry for the rest of my life. I could never thank you enough.\n",
      "I'm not really sure what binds the ACJC community, but to me, what's amazing about this school is that the student body is made of people who could fit every label you could possibly throw out - from jocks to nerds, hipsters to devout Christians, and even bengs and lians - yet we're one AC, and we build each other up and coalesce into something greater than the sum of us all. And that was how a school could become a second home to me.\n",
      "I think ex-students say this a lot, but my 2 years at ACJC are really the best I've had thus far (some NUS guy on the bus saw me in my uniform once and said this too). So to current students, I hope that in between lectures, CCA meetings, Chapel mornings, breaks in the canteen, breaks spent in the library getting pissed at the juniors (or breaks spent in the library pissing seniors off, as the case may be), you'll remember to take a moment and just enjoy where you are once in a while. You'll miss it. :)\n",
