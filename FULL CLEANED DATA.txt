It was a pretty sight...After consuming an obscene amount of food at the breakfast buffet, we packed up our things and loaded up the car to head to Asahidake Ropeway...To be fair, it was only a short walk from Hotel Bearmonte to the ropeway but the ground was covered in snow and only Joy had her mothers waterproof snow boots on. Isaac was wearing his Nike track shoes and I was wearing my Allbirds sneakers. Not the best choice for traipsing in snow...So we drove that short distance and parked the car as near to the entrance of the ropeway as possible, then took the scenic ride up Hokkaidos highest mountain ...We had a lovely hike at the Sugatami Station (altitude 1,600m), wearing borrowed rubber boots. We would have finished the full one-hour hike but snow starting falling heavily. Weather in the mountains must be respected and it can turn bad very quickly. So one must always know ones limits...Then it was lunch at the ropeway restaurant, and a drive back to Higashikawa...The next day, I decided that we would drive out to Mombetsu. Actually it was not so organized. We were just looking for breakfast and we just drove further and further away from our home base until we found ourselves back in Kamikawa, but this time we found another ramen place there. Parking our car in the snow-covered car park, we walked over to Asahi Shokudo, and we were their first customers of the day...Their ramen was worth driving from Higashikawa to Kamikawa for. Try their Maboroshi ramen made from natural Okhotsk sea salt. Limited to 20 bowls a day. I had Bowl One of Twenty...Also great, their miso ramen. Some of the best ramen Ive ever tasted. The owner, a handsome elderly gentleman whose face was on many of the photos on the wall, posing with celebrities, asked me where we were heading...Mombetsu, I blurted out, even though it was just a random thought in my mind. I  did not even know what was there. Just that I  have not been there before, and Ive covered A LOT of Hokkaido in prior trips...Ah, he said, about 95km from here.be three hours in this weather. Drive carefully, ok? Big snow...I thanked him for the advice and my teens and I drove off towards Monbetsu. Along the way, I asked Isaac to look the town up and read me some facts...Turns out Mombetsu is famous for crabs and for the port, the sea ice, and icebreaker ships. Well, it wasnt quite sea ice season but we were already on our way there, so what the heck. Lets go...The snow got heavier and heavier as I drove on the highway. I was super-cautious because we Singaporeans  do not drive in snow very often...As my children fell asleep one by one, my iPhone started playing Angels We Have Heard on High, by Sience None the Richer, though the car stereo...On my windscreen, I saw snow gently falling. In the car, I hear..Angels we have heard on high,.Singing sweetly through the night,.And the mountains in reply.Echoing their brave delight...It was like a scene out of a winter movie. Except I was also a hyper-alert father driving as carefully as I can, mindful of the sleeping young charges in my care...When we got to Mombetsu, there was no snow. Just windy cold coastal weather. I drove the kids to the Okhotsk Tower where you can normally see the sea ice in the Sea of Okhotsk and take icebreaker cruises. We settled for visiting the underwater observatory that is 8m below sea level...And oh, we also made sure we visited the giant Crab Claw Statue that is the pride of Monbetsu town. Not visiting the Crab Claw in Mombetsu is like not visiting the Merlion in Singapore, ok? Must go one...Wish I tasted some of that Monbetsu crab though. But it was a long drive back to Monbetsu, and at 4pm, it would soon be nightfall and I still had that snowy part of the highway to drive through.

It would not be practical or fun. So I decided to keep things within the centre of Hokkaido...From Shikotsuko, we drove to Higashikawa (my favourite town) and stayed at my friends B&B. Dinner was spent watching the Rugby World Cup Finals with my friends (they were rooting for England) while Isaac and Joy played with their kids, who were a few years younger. Jody and Nina adore big sister Joy, whom they met when she came visiting during my solo trip with her when she turned 12, and the girls were happy to see her again...The next morning, we set off again, without any plans once more. I thought, perhaps we could drive out to Otaru, just to have a look. Frankly, it was just an excuse to drive, as the drive itself is very pleasant. I told them, Otaru is famous for their canals...Joy asked, And?..Thats pretty much it, I said. It is one big tourist trap, to be honest, and I told them, Essentially, we are driving all the way to see Otarus Long Kangs. They laughed and were cool with their fathers rather stupid travel plans...The canals are actually quite nice when it is winter, to be honest, I added, trying to make it sound a bit more exciting...When we got to Otaru, I found a parking lot near the canals and was quite pleased it said 100 for 30 minutes. After parking, I realized I read it wrongly and it was actually 400 for 30 minutes during the day, and 100 for 30 minutes AT NIGHT...We better not stay too long, I told the kids. Joy, the financially-minded of the two, said, Ya, not worth paying that kind of parking for Long Kang...So we snapped some photos, walked around the food court a bit, and then left Otaru. I figured we would get lunch further away, en route to Sounkyo, where we planned to stay the night...Sounkyo is a quaint mountain resort area, located in Kamikawa. It is considered a touristy place, but a good base to hike Daisetsuzan National Park from. We stopped at a ramen place in Kamikawa called Yoshino, just off the highway. And wow, the ramen was great. They even had thick slices of Miton roast pork available as a side, in limited quantities. This is part of the fun of road trips: stumbling upon good places to eat...After eating at Yoshino, we drove on to Sounkyo and stopped at the Twin Waterfalls rest stop. That was when we encountered some serious cold and wind chill. It was -1C and windy there. We looked at the majestic cliffs for a bit, stared at the waterfall which was not flowing very rapidly (Spring is when the ice melts and you get a grander sight) and then we ran into the souvenir store to enjoy some heat...The store ladies were so kind, and offered us cups of soup. They had a hot pot set up with paper cups to serve their customers, and we were very thankful for the soup. So much so that I felt I had to buy some stuff there, in gratitude. I bought some sweets and grapes. You may have seen the Instastory of Joy and me eating said grapes in our ryokan later, and attempting to spit the seeds into the bowl...I asked the kids if they wanted to climb the stairs to the viewing platform but the sign said, 20 minutes and there was a sign to look out for bears. So we chickened out. Actually we were just lazy. It was too much of a climb on a cold autumns day just to see two off-peak waterfalls...We finally checked into Kumoi Hotel, a nice little place that was renovated only two years ago. Many of these onsen hotels in areas like this tend to be old and tired. A couple of the hotels I saw along the way had signs with missing words in their names. But not the Kumoi...The kids had to set up the futon beds themselves, something they learned to do in our first house, and I have to say, it is handy having two assistants to set up the beds...At least this Sounkyo area had three restaurants open till 8pm, so we did not need to tabao food. We chose an Italian place called Bear Grill, run by a handsome old man who made great food...We also stopped by the Seicomart, the Familyt of Hokkaido, to resupply our drinks and junk food. And then retired to our hotel...Because the Kumoi has its own onsen baths, I took the kids to the baths and taught the son how it works. Joy already had some eerience in our previous trip so she was fine. The son took some convincing. Nobody will look at your junk lah, I assured him...I gave him pointers on how to use an onsen, like putting a small towel on his head, and using the same small towel to cover his lower bits. The butt, that one cannot cover, the small towel was not big enough...The kids enjoyed the onsen eerience thoroughly, and we vowed to do it again when we could. And we ended our night at Sounkyo with a movie screening in the room, where I introduced them to The Matrix. Suffice to say, their minds were blown...The next morning we drove back towards Higashikawa and stopped at the Seven Stars Tree. It is a scenic spot where, I later learned, a famous oak tree, that was once used on the packaging of seven stars tobacco, stood...I only found out when I got to the Tree. Great, we drove all this way to see a cigarette advertisement. But the view was really nice lah. So it was not for nothing...We also made a stop at the Shirogane Blue Pond, which was recently upgraded with new viewing platforms and lights. There, we spotted some dumb tourists taking photos on a tree branch that grew over the water. This is why we  can not have nice things...By then it was close to sunset, and I  did not want to drive in the dark, so we drove to Hotel Bear Monte, near Asahidake mountain, where I booked a night in this bigger, fancier onsen hotel. It took a lot of talking to convince the kids that it is okay to walk around the hotel in our yukata. And even to have the buffet dinner wearing our takata...This is how the farmers used to do it, on their vacations to onsen hotels, I told the kids. They looked a little skeptical but took to it eventually. So we walked here walked there, like a boss, in our yukatas...Like Japanese farmers on their winter onsen vacations......', 'The Ban Hammer lai liao. I hope you  did not buy an e-scooter over the weekend.', 'Isaac, Joy and Papa Go Japan: Day 1 and 2..We picked up our car at Chitose Airport from Hertz/Toyota, after we flew over via Narita. Actually you  do not get the car at the airport but they have a greeting counter there and then a shuttle bus takes you to the huge lot where they have the cars and the rental office...I got a white Toyota Axio and it was as boring a family car you can get. But you also know it is reliable. I feel like my late father, who drove a Toyota Corolla, and then changed to a Toyota Corolla when the first Corollas COE eired. I understand now why he liked these cars. They just work...My teens were fairly well-behaved in their journey here. They only needed occasional reminders to put away their iPhones and pay attention to their surroundings and do the important stuff first. So my task as driver, tour guide, p are not and general do-everything person, was made slightly easier...They have grown considerably since their last trips with me. Both of them traveled solo with me when they were 12. And now they were older and more mature. It is different to deal with a kid then and now dealing with a teen. What you say to them changes, what you talk to them about, changes too. I quite enjoy interacting with these older versions of my children. There is more to share as their interests get broader...We  did not try to go too far on the first day. I was tired from the redeye flight from Singapore to Tokyo and then the 3 hour layover in Narita, followed by the flight to Chitose. So I decided to drive to Lake Shikotsu, in the town of Shikotsukoonsen, on the recommendation of my friends, Mr Miyagi and Tama-san, my remote tour guides from Singapore...Lake Shikotsu is a lovely place to chill. Its a beautiful lake and very quiet during this time of the year. We booked an entire house by the lake and spent the afternoon looking for lunch in the small town by the lake...Our first real meal in Hokkaido was awesome, and a fitting start to the trip. We were reminded by the host of our place to settle our dinner early because shops here close at 4-5pm. So while we were having lunch, we bought our burger dinner across the street. We would heat the burgers up later at the house for dinner while watching Shazam! streaming from my iPhone to the large screen TV in the living room/den...Its COLD here. It is 15-20C in Tokyo but in Hokkaido, we are looking at single digit temperatures. By the lake, the wind chill made it even colder. Good thing I packed the right layers for the kids and myself, and assumed winter weather even though, technically, its autumn...We had the heaters on full blast in the house but even then, our unacclimatized Singapore bodies still needed sweaters to keep warm...Nightfall came very quickly and it was dark by 4.30pm. By 9pm, we were already in our futons and I was about to doze off. The kids managed to stay up a bit longer watching YouTube on their phones...I was told some ghost stories by Miyagi and Tama-san regarding the lake area. Shikotsuko is  in Japanese. But sometimes the locals also call it , which is the same pronunciation. There is a lot of algae in the lake, and once you drown, no bones float, which makes it ripe for scary stories...There is the famous Shikotsuko story of the 100km Obasan. If you drive at night, the 100km Obasan will chase you and if she catches up with your car, you will die...I decided to not tell the kids the stories until we left the area. I also decided not to drive in Shikotsuko at night hahaha!..The next day, we had breakfast in town and set off, not knowing we were heading next. The kids already know Papa travels by the seat of his pants and just went with the flow. All we needed was this car, some tunes to sing along to, and each other......', 'The  Trip has begun!

He brings a quiet strength to the movie and has some of the funniest lines. This is Swarzeneggers best outing since T2...Mackenzie Davis was also a delight to watch. Her lean, statuesque figure was a nice contrast to the brute force of the Rev-9 when they fought. Grace was a good name for her. I also liked the subtle details like the surgical lines on her body...As for the other post-T2 sequels, lets call them Terminator Legends.

Based on the true story of three Americans who stopped a terrorist from shooting up a Paris train. Clumsy movie that used the real fellas acting as themselves. They  can not act. And the movie felt too long to tell the story of something that was over in a few seconds...3. Den of Thieves. Gerard Butler as Major Crimes badass vs a bunch of professional bank robbers. Better than Geostorm, lousier than Olympus Has Fallen...4. Oceans 8. Watched this on the last day of my time in SF, at an AMC cinema. Entertaining heist movie. The all-female cast was fun to watch. Awkwafina was a hoot. Not as good as Oceans Eleven (hard to beat the original) but way better than Oceans Twelve...5. The Mountain Between Us. Kate Winslet and Idris Elba try to survive crashing into a snow-covered mountain. The Revenant this aint. But Kate held the show together. A little too long and draggy. Watch only if stuck on a plane with terrible movie selection (Im looking at you, EVA Air)...6. Mollys Game.

DONT GO YET! WE HAVENT HAD ENOUGH OF YOU!  ', 'The reason why it feels so cold - even if  it is \'just\' 21C. -by  on Reddit..I have seen Singaporeans eressing their dismay at other Singaporeans for \'overreacting\' to our current climatic conditions. I have seen foreigners calling Singaporeans overly \'dramatic\', because 21 degrees is standard summer temperature in many temperate countries. This, in my opinion, is unwarranted criticism...I am in my house, with my windows open, and my toes feel cold. There has to be a reason for it...There are some elements of our current climatic condition that we  have not accounted for. These are:..-Wind chill.-Cloud cover.-Precipitation..Using this wind chill calculator, inputting a temperature of 22 degrees C and an average wind speed of 25km/h (tomorrow\'s forecast) gives us a wind chill index of 18 degrees C. That means that even if the mercury reading is 22, the \'real feel\' index is 18 degrees C.  would not four degrees cooler than 22 degrees. Inputting a temperature of 22 degrees C and a wind speed of 35km/h (tomorrow\'s maximum wind speed forecast) makes the \'real feel\' index dip to 17 degrees C.  would not five degrees cooler than the temperature on display...Make no mistake: That IS cold, for Singapore standards. Let\'s say if we were in the middle of a Sumatran squall and the wind speeds averaged 70km/h, the \'real feel\' index would be 15 degrees C. For context, the highest recorded wind speed in Singapore was 144.4km/h, recorded in 1984, and an average yearly Sumatran squall gives us wind speeds of up to 80km/h...But there\'s more. In temperate climates, a summer temperature of 21 degrees is often marked by balmy and sunny weather. The sun counteracts the effect of wind chill, if any, but we have had nothing but an overcast sky and UV indices of 0 over the last week. No sun, no sources of warmth. This, combined with the wet weather and our year-round humidity, just serves as a snowball effect of sorts. If our \'real feel\' index is 18, this can really make it feel like 16, or even colder. Remember: "Cold air with high relative humidity "feels" colder than dry air of the same temperature, because high humidity in cold weather increases the conduction of heat from the body."..Why  has not anyone pointed this out, you may ask? Well, we just never thought we\'d be talking about wind chill in this part of the world. But here we are...There\'s another element to this too: Our preparedness. In countries with temperate climes, people are eerts at layering in accordance with the weather, but we have a standard lepak outfit that we seldom deviate from. Berms, a shirt/singlet, and flip flops. Most of us  have not deviated from this standard form of attire, so of course we\'d feel cold. It feels like  it is 18 degrees, after all...Also, our houses and flats were built to withstand Singapore\'s heat and humidity. Not chilly weather. Even if there\'s a chill in temperate countries during summertime, their houses are fitted with double glazed (insulated windows) for winter anyway and can keep it out. We\'re comparatively more eosed to this kind of weather...Just putting that out there... ..REDDIT.COM.The reason why it feels so cold - even if  it is \'just\' 21 degrees C  r/singapore', 'Meanwhile, at Uniqlo..

He opened the front door and asked if he could sit in front politely as he will vomit if he sit behind(his words)..He got in, I offered him a plastic bag and a sweet which he politely declined...I confirmed his dropoff address, he nodded.

It  did not state what number, just the road name. I called him, he said he  did not know what number or where he was. He just said he was sitting at a bus stop at Bt Timah Road..Bt Timah Road is so long. I asked him to describe what he saw nearby. He said cars, trees, at a bus stop.

PM Abe was stopping over in Singapore en route to Kenya...In his condolence letter, PM Abe eressed his respect and gratitude for Mr Nathans act of courage during the Laju hijacking...In the 1974, four terrorists hijacked a ferry, the Laju, and took the crew hostage. After eight days of negotiations, they finally agreed to release the hostages in exchange for safe passage out of Singapore. Mr Nathan led a delegation of 12 Singapore officials as guarantors to accompany the hijackers to Kuwait...Fortunately the incident ended well with no casualties. But it was a serious and harrowing encounter, and Mr Nathan clearly showed his mettle in the face of uncertainty and danger...As President, Mr Nathan made a State Visit to Japan in 2009. There he met the victims of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, the first foreign Head of State to do so. PM Abe mentioned this to Mrs Nathan just now.

The endemic species are often threatened by non-native creatures and plants that were brought over by troops and other travelers from the old days. So the challenge is to eliminate the non-native threats to the islands' ecology while helping the almost extinct endemic birds, butterfly and plants to repopulate...We took a drive to see the various parts of the Hahajima island north of the populated south village. Most of it is protected forest, and the views of places like Big Bay and Long Bay are awesome...It was a little surreal to see remnants of the va can not northern village of Hahajima. In a span of a few decades, the old thriving north village is now covered by forest, the only reminders of the once-active agricultural and fishing northern village are parts of an old school and Kita port...We also saw some old military installations like a WWII-era Japanese searchlight base. I wonder what stories this searchlight base had to tell...One of the things people say you should do on Hahajima is nothing.

A volunteer of the hospice contacted me and asked if I could help fulfil the last wishes of the patients...I thought to myself, Photography can capture happy memories. If photography can be used as a tool to fulfill peoples wishes, I will be glad to offer my photographic technical know-how. I agreed...My first assignment - a wedding picture for Mdm Lee. Though she had been married for over 10 years, Mdm Lee had never taken any wedding photograph and had always yearned for one. Her wish was simple  To have a wedding photograph with her beloved partner before she bids farewell to the world...From the initial visit to the hospice to the actual photography shoot, it merely took a few days. Soon, the photographs were developed and given to Mdm Lee. The joy on Mdm Lees face when she first saw her long-awaited bridal pictures was obvious. My sense of personal satisfaction from her reaction to the photographs was immeasurable...Sadly, that was her first and last wedding photograph. Mdm Lee passed away shortly after we met...My second assignment - Mr Chia..His final wish  To eerience his first-ever ride on the Singapore Flyer with his family members...On the actual day, we took some family shots at the hospice and headed to the Singapore Flyer, with the company of the medical staff and his loved ones  for his long-anticipated eerience...Concerned with the severity of Mr Chias medical condition, the medical staff of the hospice came well-prepared with a carload of medical supplies and equipments. A wheelchair, an oxygen mask, a fan and the list went on...Mr Chias son looked somewhat uncertain and a little lost in the presence of his fragile father, not knowing how or what to do next to relieve his discomfort. Her daughter stood faithfully by his side, cleaned his mouth after he coughed and fanned him from time to time...Every family has their own stories. Often, true feelings are revealed only during a critical time when a loved one is bordering on the brink of death...The volunteer at the hospice shared that Mr Chia had passed away five days after the trip to the Singapore Flyer. Hopefully, he was at peace at that time and did not leave with many regrets...My most memorable eerience at the hospice was the photoshoot with Auntie Lucy. Auntie and her old mate had been together for more than half a century but they had never said their wedding vows...Her last wish  to have a wedding solemnisation ceremony with her beloved life partner...On the actual day of the shoot, she did not say anything and I did not probe. The doctor specially paid her a visit at her ward to check that she was in a stable condition...Doctor: Do you know where you are now?.Auntie Lucy: Im in the bridal room now..Doctor: What?.Auntie Lucy: Im getting married today, thats why Im in the bridal room now..Doctor: Hahaha, Auntie Lucy, you are very well and in good spirit indeed!..During the wedding solemnisation ceremony, Auntie Lucy could not hold back her tears. She sobbed. Twice...Her make-up was complete and they were ready for the wedding shoot. As her doting mate gently caressed her hair, she cried  for the first time...Later, as her devoted mate lifted her wedding veil, tears welled up in her eyes again. For the second time, she cried  this time, tears of happiness and contentment rolled down her cheeks...Im humbled by the fact that I have had the opportunity to do my part to help fulfill her last wish, a secret wish that had been buried in her heart for over fifty years...This project to help fulfil others dreams is still ongoing...Through my lens, I hope to do my little part to encapsulate memories and bring joy to these hospice patients before they conclude the life journeys...-.Translated by.Dorothy Ng..', ' Day 4, Miyagi Prefecture...In one day, I soaked in the outdoor onsen in Ryokan Onuma in Miyagi Prefecture where I stayed, then went hiking at Naruko Gorge, followed by lunch at Shiogama Seafood Wholesaleket (we ate FRESH tuna and salad) and a boat ride at Matsushima Bay, ending at the Godai-do Temple and tea at Kanrantei Teahouse that overlooks the bay...I have never eaten this much fresh tuna in my life.

I dragged myself off my bed and out of my room to answer the door...Through the peep hole I saw 3 Indian men standing in front of my house, I thought to myself "what the hell do they want!!"...Still puzzled and with much suspicion I opened the door. I stared  them and suddenly my eye zoomed into the middle guy\'s hand (later introduced as "Muru Muru"), I saw a familiar item on his hand and think to myself "Why TF is he holding on to my IC and what is my wallet doing on his hand!!!"...Speedily I unlocked my gate and walked out to them, Muru Muru said," is this yours? Check the one thousand dollars note inside!!". Still blur from my evening nap I immediately realized that they are angels sent from heaven to deliver my lost wallet that I  have not even realized is gone  that time...I took over my IC and pulled out my 1000 dollars note kept inside my wallet and before I said anything, he said," I am rich, I  do not need your thousand dollars"and laughed, and his two friends laughed along...Upon saying that muru2 asked the second Indian guy "Radja" to take a picture of me and him, immediately after I said "thank you guys so much, omg, omg, omg, thank you". I shook their hands and hugged them individually. I asked the last guy for his name but he refuse to say, he just kept wobbling his head. I insisted a group photo taken with my phone, right after that they just walked towards the lift...As they were leaving I had so many goosebumps, as I was seeing them off, I had so many thoughts running in my mind, I wanted to offer them money but thought to myself I spent my very last 10 dollars note on lunch and all I have is a can of coins in my room, I was thinking all so vigorously what can I give back, should I offer my one thousand dollars note since they\'re the one who found my wallet? If not how can I say thank you, how can I show gratitude?..They went into the lift and so they\'re gone...These thoughts, these feelings, this need to do something filled my 20 seconds walk into my room..I grabbed a handful of coins and ran downstairs in hope to find them and probably treat them food or drinks or anything but they are gone. ..Thank you Muru Muru, Radja and third Indian man.

Epic tank battles, killing Nazis, gritty underdogs what's not to like?..The middle was a bit draggy though. The movie is no Inglourious Basterds, even both movies have Brad Pitt in it. Fury takes itself very seriously and sometimes, that drags the pace down...We get it. War is terrible. People die. Body parts have to be cleaned off the inside of tanks...When Fury gets to the fighting parts, it is clobbering time. And even  it is even more entertaining when you know that the Americans are using peashooter M4A3E8 Sherman tanks against vastly superior German Tiger tanks...What the Shermans lacked in armor and firepower, it made up for in numbers and reliability. And the ability to travel in water. Shermans were the Zergs to the Tigers who were the over-engineered Protoss...But the German tanks were truly fearsome beasts and a single Tiger could obliterate several Shermans by itself...Sherman tanks couldn't penetrate their armor without hitting them from the sides or behind, and in one scene, the movie captures this fight brilliantly...Watching this makes me want to build model tanks again.

Many people appear not to care two hoots about both nor the basic human respect towards another human being who is a paying customer and who also happens to suffer a visual impairment...This is especially disheartening for me as my adopted country had just recently celebrated the achievements of blind PHD holders but yet the people on the ground appear not to be ready to accept the blind community in all its shapes and size...It is so frustrating for me a bona fide guide dog who was scientifically bred, went through two years of vigorous training and who holds a photo ID which is supported by the Ministry of Social and Family Development . There is no respect for the countless kind hearted people that made me possible for people like Mama...On , I guided Mama and a few blind friends to the Haagen-Dazs outlet at Holland Village at about 6.35pm. This is what I heard after guiding Mama inside the door...HV staff: Would you like a table inside or not?.Mama: Inside please..HV staff: But Mdm, no pets. Can you leave the dog outside?.Mama: I am blind, and this is my guide dog that guides me around..HV staff: Wait, I call my manager..Lady Manager standing at the door not talking, facing away from Mama.Mama: Are you the manager? Please take a look at this legislation from NEA, excluding guide dogs from the no pets policy to the Public Environmental Health Act. This is also a card with MSF's support allowing guide dogs into all public spaces..Lady Manager: No pets, mdm..Mama: This is not a pet as I have elained,  it is my guide dog, and I need it as I am blind..Lady Manager : I only the assistant manager..Mama: Where is your manager?. Gentlemen clearing throat: I am the manager!.Mama: Yes, as I was telling both your staff, I am blind and this is my guide dog. Please take a look at this legislation from NEA excluding guide dogs from the no pets policy to the Public Environmental Health Act. This is also a card with MSF's support allowing guide dogs into all public places..Male Manager : No pets, mdm..Mama: Are you saying you would not allow my guide dog and I to sit inside Haagen Dazs?.Male Manager: No mdm, not you, just the dog..Mama: What about the white canes of my friends, do they need to be parked outside as well?.Male Manager: Mdm, my company policy is no pets. Please understand..Mama: As I have said before, this is not a pet! it is a working dog for a blind person..Male Manager: Mdm, my company policy is no pets. Please understand..Mama: All right. In that case, I am happy to take my business elsewhere..Mama standing outside the store facebooking about the rejection..Male Manager stepping outside the store: Mdm, I never say cannot, you never gave me a chance to read the paper..Mama: I showed it both to you and the lady manager, and I have been holding it in my hands all the 10 minutes in the store. Why are you only concern now that I am facebooking?.Male Manager: But  it is Sunday and my head office is closed!.Mama:  it is all right, because on Sundays blind people also  do not need to eat ice-cream.

It was a Sunday afternoon (to be exact,, around 1pm), shoppers from the neighbourhood gather here to run their weekly errands. The popularity of the grocery store (initials: JG, near tropicana golf club) could be seen from the number of cars parked in front of it. Some customers including me had to leave our cars by the curb below the slope because the designated parking lots were occupied...I opened the passenger\'s car door and before I could chuck anything into the car, someone held both of my arms. I immediately turned around and asked " buat apa?" or what do you want. It was a fairly plump Malay fellow in his 30s who asked me to pay him money. "for what?" i asked. Another male, Indian, dressed up smartly with a white long sleeved shirt and a pair of black pants came walking towards us while holding a walkie talkie. He said "you parking sini perlu bayar!" if you parked your car here, you have to pay us. It did not make any sense to me because every other time I parked my car there, i never had to pay any money to anyone and the malay fellow was still grabbing my arm. And then I had the notion that he was trying to push me into the car...Within a split second of thought, I shouted help repeatedly at the top of my lungs. It was the freakiest moment of my life. While resisting and doing anything I could to stop them from pushing me into the car including punching the fat guy in front of me, one of them grabbed my neck. While the fight was going on, I heard people shouting and cars honking (thanks people!). Before the other shoppers could run over and help, the robbers cum potential kidnappers snatched the car key, pushed me away and quickly hopped into the car. And then I saw one of them ignited the engine. Subconsciously, I thought I should stop them from getting away and so I got hold of the car door firmly and prayed that someone could do something, anything. But it was just a meager effort. Three big-sized fellows escaped with my car...It was a great relief that I was not abducted and that I only got bruises and no major injuries. Before they got away, I noticed there was a light green colored car that was parked right behind my car which disappeared after the whole episode of car snatching incident. I also noticed that this gang of people did not even bother to cover their face.  it is either because they did not want to raise any suspicions or they did not eect me to have escaped the attempted kidnapping. It was a well planned out, near perfect activity!..After this incident, I realized that you are on your own when things like this happen to you, many people would just stand there and stare, only a few good samaritans would actually help you even if they do not know you. Before you approach your car, remember to look around and be alert of any suspicious people lurking around. Things like this can happen anywhere, anytime of the day and to anyone.  it is very important to stay calm and come up with the best solution using the resources around you.
