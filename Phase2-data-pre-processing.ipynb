& single.as much as this isn't 100% true, i feel that generally when guys are single, they tend to 'select' the girls whom they want to talk to and filter those whom they do not want to give a wrong impression that they might like them. hence, it is harder to break the barrier of talking to them. however, those who are attached or gay are so open to conversations such that it becomes very enjoyable to talk to them. on that note, as much as i like talking to them, i will make sure that i still keep my distance from those attached coz i have 0 intention of breaking any relationships.this, is probably one of the main reasons why i am still a single coz all the guys that i can communicate with are all attached or gay. .- girl who just wanna rant about life.confess at:
