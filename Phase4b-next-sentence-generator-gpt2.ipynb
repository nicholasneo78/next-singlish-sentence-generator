ending of the first two chapters. i think that's just the feeling of a disappointment that i did not deserve to finish my story even though it was already done. it still feels good after but i do not think i have fully decided if i want to continue reading. i am sad this is an issue that has not happened in this series i have written thus far... not only that i do not know the outcome at all, but i will not even know my own story that i am going to.\n","\n","so, it has been more than a week and i have no sleep yet. i am tired of living with the stress of daily tasks. i went home from work and had a great start in my work with this project, i was really glad that i found out in no time. to say i am too lazy is an understatement. i have to stay up during 3-4 hours a day as well as for hours after but for the most part, it is me getting up during the day after. i am not used to that because i have to work so much during the day, especially on weekends and holidays. but i must say, it is nice knowing that there is something to be achieved. i am not sure if it is my own happiness but my own work and the fact i am not working, or if my boss is the one trying to make this project harder is something that I have not had the courage to share in time.\n","\n","i am really tired of being able to write more and to not waste too much on one thing. \n","\n","thank you everyone for giving me this opportunity, i sincerely pray to you guys, one day everyone will be able to complete your story without the burden of a single effort that would have prevented you from writing the book. and i will continue to work hard for my story!. to the people who have helped me, thank you. to the people who gave me the opportunity to continue my story without giving up. thank you for giving me the opportunity to continue my own story!.\n","\n","i finally have a story. but it seems like it is my last book to finish. how do i finish the story?\n","\n","i am reading your first post and the first sentence is just too long. i cannot finish this one at this point, will not finish this one too soon. but there are some other people you can help and i did not know if i had. but for me, the biggest challenge for me is the writing. i do not know how to read the story of the person or the sentence. but for a story like this, i am pretty desperate. so, with your help, i will go ahead and start writing a story about my life and how i got to where i am, before the end. that will have a major impact on my writing. i am very lucky.\n","\n","i am a self proclaimed 'energetic, fun & funny teacher'. no matter how many kids do you grow up with, their school life is forever and always will be different and they will always be different as well. so, after i start, i think it is my task to continue to continue to improve my writing. and i realised that writing is so hard, and the hardest thing is not working out to get better. it is not so easy to reach a goal when you do not get motivated by what you do.\n","\n","i just came home from school, and i did not work out so much. i was at my best with the writing but after reading this blog post, i am tired of me having this feeling and i did not feel that i could not work on something. it does not matter if it is a bad teacher or not.. how it feels is not a problem to me. so, in the beginning, i tried to make sure i was getting on time with my work as it is such a stressful job in school. but after i read your blog post i decided it is not working out for me or for my work. i feel like i can still write.\n","\n","i am currently studying for a PhD. i am at this point thinking more about what i am doing and how i am doing it than how to solve the problem. i am currently reading your first story and wondering what i am writing about. will it be good? please let us know who has been helping me.\n","\n","i have been studying for my PhD, and i was wondering, will the next project be different in that?\n","\n","i

till i meet the right man to get my first girlfriend together!! you guys have been so supportive \n","if anything, this time we talked about our feelings and everything, in between our awkward moments of having a crush on another guy. i would say i am in a bad mood because i have not gotten what i was hoping to get, but the fact that i am not is probably a sign of my depression. but hey, i only have the one thing that i wanna know, do not get angry at me! do not get angry at me for not being happy with what you did. do not get upset because i did not get what i promised to not be happy with because you gave me what i wanted. but i just have to focus on my job, i can not concentrate on being happy, and i am not happy for anyone like me! what i do want is someone with me and would not do anything to get to know that person.- \n","i have had the privilege of working in the area where the average male is only . i think there are a lot of guys who would call themselves nerds and not be as into anime as the females who are more into gaijin. but there are guys like yourself who would want their own unique style of life and have a passion for video games as well. my personal style is in terms of fighting games. while it is cute, in terms of gaming, it does not really interest me at all, even though my friends like it, they're just looking for it.- \n","a super nice girl! i hope i can have more opportunities to meet you guys if that is alright with you guys, you have been so friendly with my girl since school! thanks for giving a nice smile again!.- \n","i have been thinking about whether i should be a teacher in a non-singapore university because it was in a school run by the university in singapore, even though i did not have any interest in education. what if there's a university school that offers only a single class?, i really hope they get me to study as a lecturer in the second grade and so that i will not have to rely on being promoted to the first-grade lecturers. but if so, you guys, you guys, are really a wonderful group of people who really love us and will always take care of us so that we may be treated as a family someday! you're the group of professors and teachers who are really good that i really love and will always take care of me!! just please go to\n","\n","Saving checkpoint/run1/model-90\n","[100 | 401.55] loss=3.86
